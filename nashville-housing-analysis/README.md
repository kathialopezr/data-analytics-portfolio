# Nashville Housing Data — Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, organizing, and exploring a real-world housing dataset from Nashville, Tennessee.  
It demonstrates foundational data analytics skills including data cleaning, standardization, transformation, and exploratory analysis using Google Sheets.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.  
- Explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.  
- Extract actionable insights and visualize the findings.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source:** Public Nashville Housing Dataset (Kaggle)  
- **File:** `nashville_housing.csv`  
- **Rows:** ~56,000  
- **Description:** Contains property sales records, addresses, prices, ownership details, and transaction dates.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps (Completed)
These steps were performed using **Google Sheets**:

### ✅ 1. Standardized date formats  
Converted the `SaleDate` column into a consistent date format using *Format → Number → Date*.

### ✅ 2. Split property address into components  
Used *Data → Split text to columns* with comma as delimiter to separate street and city fields.

### ✅ 3. Removed duplicate records  
Applied *Data → Data cleanup → Remove duplicates* to eliminate repeated rows.

### ✅ 4. Standardized text fields  
Used the `PROPER()` function to format owner names and other text fields into consistent capitalization.

### ✅ 5. Optional transformations  
Separated owner first and last names using *Split text to columns* (space delimiter).

## 📈 Analysis & Visualization
I created charts and visual summaries to better understand the data:  
- Bar charts to show category comparisons.  
- Line charts for trends during 2013.  
- Basic descriptive statistics (average, median, etc.).
